# Codes-
A collection of the various codes I have developed throughout college.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MATLAB:

1. bisec.m              -   A MATLAB function that utilizes the bisection method to find the
                            zeroes in functions. 
2. orbitaltrajectory.m  -   A MATLAB function (in development) that will model the orbits of
                            satellites around Earth.

Mathematica:

1. Surface2.nb          -   A Mathematica module designed to take a parametrized surface and 
                            return values of importance for differential geometry.
2. OrbitalTrajectory.nb -   A Mathematica module (in development) that will model the orbits
                            of satellites around Earth and generate Keplerian elements.

Python:

1. Project Euler        -   A collection of all of my Project Euler codes written in Python.
