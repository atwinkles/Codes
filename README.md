# Codes-
A collection of the various codes I have developed throughout college.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

MATLAB:

1. bisec.m              -   A MATLAB function that utilizes the bisection method to find the
                            zeroes in functions. 
2. orbitaltrajectory.m  -   A MATLAB function (in development) that will model the orbits of
                            satellites around Earth.
3. newton.m             -   A MATLAB function that utilizes Newton's method to approximate
                            zeroes in functions.
4. steffensen.m         -   A MATLAB function that utilizes the Steffensen method to approximate
                            zeroes in functions.

Mathematica:

1. Surface2.nb          -   A Mathematica module designed to take a parametrized surface and 
                            return values of importance for differential geometry.
2. OrbitalTrajectory.nb -   A Mathematica module (in development) that will model the orbits
                            of satellites around Earth and generate Keplerian elements.

Python:

1. Project Euler        -   A collection of all of my Project Euler codes written in Python. 
                            These codes are solely to demonstrate coding skills - if you are
                            working on Project Euler I highly encourage you NOT to look at these
                            as they take the fun out of the problems!
